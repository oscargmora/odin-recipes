            These are a series of dishes near and dear to my heart.
            From my beautiful girlfriend's cooking in the cajun chicken pasta during our date nights, to my mom's famous Ecuadorian style cooking, to Gordon Ramsay's world-renowned Beef Wellington, there is a dish here for eveybody!
